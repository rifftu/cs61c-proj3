Q: Can you think of an analogy between the process of tesselating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways? 
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?

A:
the hexagon is the room, and the tesselation is the whole world

Q: If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first?
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tesselating hexagons.

A:
method to build the single room first
Q: What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?

A:
hallway start and end from a room, room can have any number of hallway
they are both rectangle
Q: For tesselating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implemention, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?

A:

The difference between theirs and ours is that theirs is really well thought out and implemented and ours is bad and nonexistant. :(

Q: Consider an algorithm for placing rooms and hallways on your map.
Ideally, consider many algorithms and think about what makes some easier or harder to implement. Try and bring those ideas together into a single simple algorithm which accomplishes the task.
In general, algorithms with as few edge cases as possible are better algorithms.

A: we could start with one room, then create random hallways leading out from the room, then rooms as the end of each hallway, then do the same thing on the new rooms. at each step, we check to make sure that it only creates new rooms where there is enough space (ie doesn't touch existing rooms or the edge of the world)
